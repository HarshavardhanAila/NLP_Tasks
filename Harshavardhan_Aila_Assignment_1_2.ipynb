    "##How can we incorporate contextual information beyond individual words into the tokenization process to improve performance on downstream tasks like machine translation or question answering?"

    "Answer Here: We need to consider the following tasks to incorporate the contextual information beyond individual words into the tokenization process to improve performance downline machine translation or question answering: Subword tokenization, wordpeice tokenization, sentence peice tokenization, Byte level or character level tokenization and task-specific tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Byte pair encoding or the unigram language model is used instead of dividing/splitting the text into individual words. The another subword tokenization approach is word piece whcih splits the words into smaller parts. It is same as BPE but differs in handling the spliiting process. It is widely used across NLP frameworks like GPT and BERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another Unsupoervised text tokenizerwhich can handle several tokenization tasks including the character and subword tokenization is SentencePiece which uses the unigran language model algorithm and can be trained on large corpus which captures contextual information effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Byte-Level or Character-Level Tokenization can tokenize at the byte level or character level. This is useful when with languages that do not have a clear word boundaries or when dealing with where characters play a crucial role, example handwriting recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Task-Specific Tokenization can design task-specific tokenization approaches which takes into account the specific requirements of the task. In the example of question answering, we may want to include special tokens to mark the start and end of the answer span.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it's worth saying that tokenization is just the first step, and by using the pre-trained language models like BERT or GPT can further incorporate the contextual information during fine-tuning on downstream tasks. These models leverage transformer architectures that capture contextual dependencies between tokens through attention mechanisms, allowing them to understand the meaning of words in context.\n",

It consists of a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, allowing you to perform various text-related tasks such as text validation, data extraction, text cleaning, and more. Regular expressions are used in programming languages and text editors and are constructed using a combination of regular characters, special characters, and metacharacters to specify search criteria. Learning to use regular expressions effectively can greatly enhance text processing tasks, making them a valuable skill in fields like natural language processing, data extraction, and data validation."

    "inau_text=\"\"\"The custom of delivering an address on Inauguration Day started with the very first Inauguration—George Washington’s—on April 30, 1789(04-30-1789). ex:-18.5. After taking his oath of office on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York City, Washington proceeded to the Senate chamber where he read a speech before members of Congress and other dignitaries. His second Inauguration took place in Philadelphia on March 4, 1793(03/04/1793), in the Senate chamber of Congress Hall. There, Washington gave the shortest Inaugural address on record—just 135 words —before repeating the oath of office.\n",
    "Every President since Washington has delivered an Inaugural address. While many of the early Presidents read their addresses before taking the oath, current custom dictates that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court administer the oath first, followed by the President’s speech.\n",
    "William Henry Harrison delivered the longest Inaugural address, at 8,445 words, on March 4, 1841—a bitterly cold, wet day. He died one month later of pneumonia, believed to have been brought on by prolonged exposure to the elements on his Inauguration Day. John Adams’ Inaugural address, which totaled 2,308 words, contained the longest sentence, at 737 words. After Washington’s second Inaugural address, the next shortest was Franklin D. Roosevelt’s fourth address on January 20, 1945(01-20-1945), at just 559.0 words. Roosevelt had chosen to have a simple Inauguration at the White House in light of the nation’s involvement in World War II.\n",
    "In 1921, Warren G. Harding became the first President to take his oath and deliver his Inaugural address through loud speakers. In 1925, Calvin Coolidge’s Inaugural address was the first to be broadcast nationally by radio. And in 1949, Harry S. Truman became the first President to deliver his Inaugural address over television airwaves.\n",
    "Most Presidents use their Inaugural address to present their vision of America and to set forth their goals for the nation. Some of the most eloquent and powerful speeches are still quoted today. In 1865, in the waning days of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln stated, “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.” In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt avowed, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself.” And in 1961, John F. Kennedy declared, “And so my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.”\n",
    "Today, Presidents deliver their Inaugural address on the West Front of the Capitol, but this has not always been the case. Until Andrew Jackson’s first Inauguration in 1829, most Presidents spoke in either the House or Senate chambers. Jackson became the first President to take his oath of office and deliver his address on the East Front Portico of the U.S. Capitol in 1829. With few exceptions, the next 37.0 Inaugurations took place there, until 1981, when Ronald Reagan’s Swearing-In Ceremony and Inaugural address occurred on the West Front Terrace of the Capitol. The West Front has been used ever since. You should also need to extract the floating numbers such as -55.5, 20.8%, -3.0 using your regular expression\"\"\"\n"

    "The morphology of a language, specifically whether it is agglutinative or fusional, can impact the suitability of stemming and lemmatization techniques for text processing. Understanding different types of morphological structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stemming: It is a process of reducing words to their base or root form, called a stem which involves removing prefixes, suffixes, and inflectional endings from words. Relatively regular and transparent word structureAgglutinative languages are well-suited for stemming because of the morphological components in the agglutinative languages are often clearly separable, making it easier to identify and remove affixes.Stemming is particularly effective in agglutinative languages because the affixes are typically easily identifiable and separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lemmatization: It involves determining the base or dictionary form of a word, known as the lemma.  The word's context and grammatical features to produce the correct base form. Fusional languages, which often have complex and irregular word forms, benefit more from lemmatization. This is because lemmatization considers the syntactic and semantic information of a word to produce its base form, which can vary significantly in fusional languages.Lemmatization is more suitable for fusional languages because it considers the word's context, syntactic role, and grammatical features to determine the base or dictionary form of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the choice between stemming and lemmatization depends on the morphology of the language being processed. Agglutinative languages with regular and transparent structures are more suitable for stemming, while fusional languages with complex and irregular word forms benefit from lemmatization. In practical text processing applications, it's often beneficial to consider both stemming and lemmatization approaches, depending on the requirements and linguistic characteristics of the language being analyzed. However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of these techniques can vary depending on the specific language and the context in which they are applied.\n"

It was given to visit new website for more information where we can still download stanfordnlp via pip, but newer versions of this package will be made available as stanza. I have used  stanza for lemmatization, stopwords from nltk.corpus for stopwords, and word_tokenize from nltk.tokenize for tokenization Using NLTK library it provides a wide range of natural language processing functionalities and created a lemmatize_and_remove_stopwords function for removal of stop words. In this I have achieved lemmatization of sentence using different stopwords. The final words are printed as output which has no stopwords in it."
